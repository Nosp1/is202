           <ol>
               <li>Create a Prepared Statement object </li>
               <li>The code will typically be something like: 

                   public void skrivStudenter(PrintWriter out) <br>
                   { <br>
                   PreparedStatement getStudents; <br>         
                   try { <br>
                   getStudents = conn.prepareStatement("select * from student order by ?");<br>
                   getStudents.setString(1,"firstName");<br>
                   <br>
                   ResultSet rset = getStudents.executeQuery();<br>
 
                   // Step 4: Process the ResultSet by scrolling the cursor forward via next(). <br>
                   //  For each row, retrieve the contents of the cells with getXxx(columnName). <br>
                   out.println("The records selected are:" +"<br>"); <br>
                   int rowCount = 0; <br>
                   while(rset.next()) {   <br>
                   ...............................

          </p>
          <p class="blue">     For Student, we have a Servlet, here called RetrieveData. 
                  The new thing is that we have a tool class for Student, here
                  called StudentTools. The structure we will try to follow is 
                  that when a request is "ordered" from the user, the Servlet will 
                  create the necessary toold, that means objects, and call the 
                  necessary methods. The logic and details should be in the tool, 
                  the Servlet should be as "clean" and simple as possible.
