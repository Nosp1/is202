    <h1>Secure Webapp - Login Form</h1>
    <p>This is the login form page. You can design this page as you like,
      but there are some a couple of rules to follow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The input fields for username and password must be named
        <code>"j_username"</code> and <code>"j_password"</code>,
        respectively</li>
      <li>and the value of the form's action attribute must be
        "j_security_check"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the user attempts to go to a page that is protected by one of the
      security-constraints in web.xml, she will be redirected to the login
      page. On successful authentication she will be redirected again,
      this time to the page she was trying to get to. If the authentication fails
      she will be redirected to the failed login page. The names (or rather
      urls) of these pages are specified in web.xml.</p>


    <form action="j_security_check" >
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Username:</td>
          <td><input type="text" name="j_username"/></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Password:</td>
          <td><input type="text" name="j_password"/></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><input type="submit" value="Log in!" /></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </form>
