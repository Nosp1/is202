          <p class="blue">     For Student, we have a Servlet, here called RetrieveData. 
                  The new thing is that we have a tool class for Student, here
                  called StudentTools. The structure we will try to follow is 
                  that when a request is "ordered" from the user, the Servlet will 
                  create the necessary toold, that means objects, and call the 
                  necessary methods. The logic and details should be in the tool, 
                  the Servlet should be as "clean" and simple as possible.
