    <h2>Html forms and links</h2>
    <p>This note will explain how to create html forms.</p>

    <h3>Forms</h3>
    <p>Forms is a way to send input to web applications. They allow the user
      to provide input by filling in forms, select various options, and even
      upload files.</p>

    <p>The html tag used to make forms is, unsurprisingly, form. The form tag
      has many attributes, but only two of them are strictly necessary:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The method attribute tells the client (browser) which type
        of request to use when the form is sent to the server.
      </li>
      <li>The action attribute tells the client where to send the
        request. It is specified as a url to a servlet. There is a strong
        coupling between the servlet and the form, but it is not much that
        can be done about it.  The servlet must know what the form contains,
        otherwise it will be unable to process it, seen from the other side:
        the form must provide the input that the servlet expects.</li>
    </ul>

    <pre lang="html">
&lt;form metod="post" action="url-to-form-processor"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Form content --&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>When the user clicks on a <a href="#submit_button">submit button</a>
      the browser creates a new message of the type specified by the method
      attribute, and include all the data from the form and sends it to
      the servlet specified by the action attribute.</p>
    <p>The main difference between get and post methods is that if post
      is specified the browser will send a post message with the form data
      in the message body. If get is specified the browser sends a get message
      and since get messages do not have a body, the form data will be
      encoded in the url.  There are two cases where you must use the post
      method: If the form will start a non-reversible action, such as
      confirming an order in a webshop, post must be used. The other case
      is if the form contains data that cannot be encoded in the url, e.g.
      a fileupload</p>

    <h3>The input tag</h3>

    <h3 id="submit_button">Submit buttons</h3>

    <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
  </body>
</html>
