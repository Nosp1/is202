    <h1>IS-202 Lecture Notes</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to concepts</h2>
    <p>When you are surfing the web, you are probably paying much more attention
      to the displayed content, than to how it actually works, as you float from
      page to page. However, a lot of what you will be told in this course is
      not always meaningful, unless you know the context. That is the purpose of
      this note: To give you an overview of how the web works, and give you the
      insight to see how all the seemingly unrelated pieces fit together.</p>
    <p>A textbook would define the web as something like:</p>
    <blockquote> The world wide web (abbreviated WWW) is a distributed
      information space, where documents and other resources are available over
      the internet. The resources are identified by uniform resource locators.
      The documents are connected with hypertext links.</blockquote>

    <h3>Navigating the web</h3>
    <p>How do you get from one page to another? A user interface designer might
      draw a map like the one in <a
          href="#fig1">figure 1</a>. This map tells you which pages are connected
      with links, but as a developer you need to know how the system manages to
      replace what you can see in the browser, when you navigate to a new page. </p>

    <figure id="nav1">
      <img src="image/nav1.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 1: Simple sitemap</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The web resources are kept on servers, so every time you move on to
      another document, the client (browser) must get the the document, and
      possibly some other resources from one or more servers. When the user
      clicks on a link, (or types in the URL, the browser will send a request
      for the document to the server. The server responds with a message that
      contains the requested document. When the browser has received the
      document it will scan it, to find links to resources that are embedded in
      the document (e.g. pictures or stylesheets), send a request for each
      resource, and display the resource when it is received from server.</p>
    <p>The location of the resources are specified with URLs, e.g.
      <code>http://server/path/to/resource</code>. Http is the communication
      protocol, i.e. the rules for communication between web browsers and
      servers, Next is the server ip address or its dns name, and the rest
      identifies the resource on the server.</p>
    <p>If we install this page on a web server, and you click on a link to it,
      your browser will send a message to the server, asking for the file. The
      server will respond with a status code, and a stream of the characters in
      the file. Your browser will read the character stream, and when it gets to
      the figure below, it will send a new message to the server, asking for the
      image file that is used in the figure. Actually, yet another message has
      been sent, to get the stylesheet that there is a link to in the file
      header. These linked objects willl often be received from the same server,
      but they don't have to. It is perfectly fine to have all the images on a
      separate server, for instance.</p>

    <figure
        id="nav2"><img
          src="image/nav2.png" />
      <figcaption>Figure 2: Communication between browser and
        server(s)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p><a href="#nav2">Figure 2</a> shows in much more detail what will happen if
      the user clicks on the link to intro in figure 1:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>We assume that the user either types the url to index.html in the
        address field in his browser, or selects it from his bookmark list. The
        browser sends a request to the server referred to in the link, for the
        document index.html</li>
      <li>The server responds by sending the requested document to the browser.
        The browser will display it in the browser window, replacing whatever
        the user was viewing before.</li>
      <li> If the user wants to read the intro he will click on the link to it,
        which will make the browser send a new request to the server, this time
        asking for intro.html. </li>
      <li>The server responds by sending the document to the browser. This time,
        however, the browser discovers that the document contains several links
        to other resources that should be displayed as part of the document. </li>
      <li> Intro.html contains a link to a stylesheet, so the browser sends a
        request to the server, asking for the stylesheet. Note that the
        stylesheet is retrieved from a different server than the document. This
        may be a little unusual, but the it is handled just like any other
        request.</li>
      <li>The server returns the stylesheet</li>
      <li>The browser finds several links to images (only one is shown here).
        These are handled in the same way as the stylesheet: A request is sent
        to the server</li>
      <li>The server responds by sending the image back to the browser.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may have noticed that there is a pattern in the communication: The
      browser sends requests for documents and other resources, and the server
      responds by sending them to the browser. The important conclusions to draw
      from this is that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigation from one page to another requires at least one
        request/response roundtrip to a server</li>
      <li>The only way to change what the user sees in his browser is to request
        a new page from a server, and this must be initiated by the user. (We
        disregard client side scripting here, since it is not part of the
        course)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <a href="#http">HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a>, the rules for
      communication between web clients (browsers) and server is described in
      more detail <a href="#http">below</a>. There is also a section that covers
      <a href="urls">Uniform Resource Locators (URL)</a>. A thorough presentation
      of the The HyperText Markup Language (HTML), requires more space, so it is
      covered in a separate note</p>

    <h2>URLs : Uniform Resource Locators</h2>
    <p>Uniform Resouce Locator, or URL is the address format of the web.  A URL
      specifies exactly where, and to some extent how, a resource on the web
      can be found.  The course catalogue page for IS-202 should be an appriopriate
      place to start. The URL is:</p>
    <pre>
        https://www.uia.no/studieplaner/topic/IS-202-1
    </pre>
    <p>We can see that this url contains the same parts as the obviously fake
      url shown in the example above. It starts with the protocol specifier
      specifies the communication protocol that must be used to retrieve the
      resource. Next is the network address of the host computer. <code>www.uia.no</code>
      is a DNS name. DNS is like a phonebook for the internet, it maps readable
      names to ip addresses.  Numerical ip addresses can also be used, both forms
      will uniquely identify a computer on the internet.  You will
      use a special ip address a lot in this course:  The ip loopback address
      <code>127.0.0.1</code> allow you to connect to you own computer over the
      internet. You can also use the DNS name form localhost.  Both forms can
      be used to refer to your own computer.  Note that a web server is not a
      computer.  It is a program.  The computer that the web server (or any
      other server)runs on is called a host.
    </p>

    <p>The last major part of the url is the resource path, which specifies
      exactly where the server can find the resource.  A get request for the url
      above tells uia's web server that the client is asking for the document identified
      by /studieplaner/topic/IS-202-1, sent over the secure http protocol (https),
      from the web server runnning on the host www.uia.no.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you must append a port number to the host address, like this:
      <code>localhost:8080</code>.  If the port number is not specified in the
      url, it means that the standard port should be used.  Which port depends
      on the protocol, http uses port number 80.  However, it is often convenient
      to use another port number during development.  Port 80 and the other default
      ports can only be assigned by a system administrator.  If you need to test
      different server configurations, you can assign the servers to different
      ports, and run all on the same host. Common alternative ports for http
      are 8080 and 8181, if you need more, any number larger than 1024, and
      preferably contains the digit 8 (e.g. 1080, 1088, 10080) is all right.</p>

    <h3>Relative urls</h3>
    <p>The <a href="#httprequest">"request messages</a> contain the equivalent
      of a full url.  We would rather not use full urls in the links between
      pages in a web application.  If the application is installed at different
      locations during development and production, it will be necessary, to find
      and change the url of every link in the system. This is at best an
      inconvenience, but also a source of bugs. Luckily for us, we don't have to.
      We can use relative urls in the links.</p>
    <p>Consider a web application that consists of three pages with the
      following urls:</p>
    <pre>
      http://fixit.com/projects/soapbox/index.html
      http://fixit.com/projects/soapbox/onepage.html
      http://fixit.com/projects/soapbox/prices/no.html
      http://fixit.com/projects/soapbox/prices/en.html
    </pre>
    <p>The appliction will be installed at the soapbox company and the urls become:</p>
    <pre>
      http://soapbox.com/index.html
      http://soapbox.com/onepage.html
      http://soapbox.com/prices/no.html
      http://soapbox.com/prices/en.html
    </pre>
    <p>If we remove soapbox and everything in front in the dev urls, we get
      exactly the same result as removing everything up to and including .com
      in the production urls would do.  This is the idea behind relative urls.</p>
    <p>A relative url is always relative to the document that contains the link.
      If index.html contains links to onepage.html and prices/no.html, the browser must
      reconstruct the full url before sending the request to the server.  It starts
      with the full url of the page that contains the links (index.html) and replaces
      the last part (index.html) with the relative url.  To get a full url to no.html
      replace index.html must be replaced with prices/no.html</p>
    <p>If there is a link in no.html to en.html, the relative url is just
      en.html. And a final example: A link in no.html back to index.htm would
      require the relative url ../index.html.  This may not work. The server may
      block urls containing <code>..</code> because it may be a security risk.</p>
    <p>Relative urls are only useful when linking to other pages within the
      application.  Use a full url when linking to external resources.</p>

    <h3>Java EE urls and url paterns</h3>
    <p>Java EE has some special constructs for handling urls.  The resource path
      is divided into a context path and a servlet path.  The following example
      shows the resulting parts:</p>
    <pre>
      http://server:port/contextpath/servletpath
    </pre>
    <ul>
      <li>The protocol, server address, and port number is exactly as described above</li>
      <li>The contextpath identifies the application.  The default contextpath
        is the name of the deployed war file, but this can be overridden in context.xml</li>
      <li>The servletpath identifies a servlet within the application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="http">HTTP: The HyperText Transfer Protocol</h2>
    <p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol defines the rules for communication
      between web servers and browsers. As noted above the protocol is quite
      simple: The browser sends a request for a document, and the server
      responds with a message that contains the requested document.</p>
    <p>It is useful to know a little more about http, in particular when
      things do not work as expected. The remainder of this note describes
      the protocol and the messages it transfers in more detail</p>


    <h3>Detailed description of HTTP</h3>
    <p> HTTP is an application level protocol: It defines communication between
      parts of an application (browser and server), and it depends on a
      transport protocol such as tcp to actually send the messages.</p>
    <p>The communication is initiated by the browser when the user clicks on a
      link, or types a URL:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First the browser opens a TCP connection to the specified port on the
        server. Strictly speaking this is not part of the HTTP protocol, but the
        connection is needed to send any HTTP messages.</li>
      <li>When the connection is established the browser sends an HTTP request
        message. There are several types of request messages. These are
        described below.</li>
      <li>The web server responds with an HTTP response message. The response
        usually contains the requested resource, but it may also contain error
        messages or other information. The resource is typically an html
        document, or perhaps an image, but it can be any kind of data.</li>
      <li>In the original version of the protocol the browser would shut down
        the TCP connection after the response had been received.  Current
        web browsers and servers will usually keep the connection open in
        anticipation of further requests from the browser (for example to
        retrieve images linked to by a
        page).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="httprequest">HTTP Request Messages</h3>
    <p>Request messages are allways sent by the browser to the server.</p>
    <p>The most common request is GET request, which is used to retrieve
      resources, i.e. to follow links. The server’s response to GET requests
      usually contains the requested resource in the message body, but the
      server will send an error message instead if the resource is unavailable.
      If you enter the URL http://www.uia.no/index.html in a browser, the
      following request would be sent:</p>
    <pre>
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
    </pre>
    <p>Note that GET requests are meant to be used to retrieve information. You
      should never use GET requests to perform irreversible actions, such as
      placing an order, or charging the user’s credit card. The user should get
      exactly the same result whether he clicks just once or several times on a
      link. If you want to perform an action that makes an irreversible change
      to the state of the system, you should use a form to send POST request
      instead.</p>
    <p>The POST request method is used to send data to the server (e.g. the data
      entered in an HTML form - including fileuploads). The data is included in
      the body of the request. The server may use the data to add new resources,
      or change existing ones.</p>
    <p>The data is sent to the server as request parameters. Each parameter has
      a name and a value. With POST requests, parameters are usually encoded in
      the request body. Even GET requests can have parameters, but they do not
      have a body, so any parameters must be encoded in the URL. We will have a
      closer look at parameters in section TODO xref html</p>
    <p>Web servers are only required to implement the GET and POST methods. The
      other request methods are optional, and are rarely used, so we will not go
      into them here.</p>

    <h3>HTTP Responses</h3>
    <p>Response messages are sent by the browser, as a response to a request
      sent by the browser. The first line of the HTTP Response message contains
      a three-digit status code:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1xx codes are informational.</li>
      <li>2xx status codes indicate successful processing of the request.</li>
      <li>3xx status codes are used to redirect the browser to another URL.</li>
      <li>4xx status codes indicate that something is wrong with the request.
        The most common is probably 404 which is sent when the requested
        resource does not exist.</li>
      <li>5xx status codes indicate a server error while processing the
        request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depending on the status code the response message may contain additional
      data. The most common status code is 200, which is used when a request has
      been successfully processed, and the resources is being sent in the
      response body.</p>
    <p>The response message is handled by the browser, so we do not need to go
      into more detail. Note however that 4xx and 5xx response will cause the
      browser to display an error message with no link back to the application.
      This is not very user friendly. Therefore you should always try to return
      a normal page, even when something goes wrong in the handling of a
      request. A page with a helpful message and links that allow the user to
      proceed is a lot better than returning just an error status.</p>
