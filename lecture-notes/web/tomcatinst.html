    <h2>Installing netbeans and tomcat</h2>
    <p>The easiest way to install netbeans and tomcat, is to download the
      JavaEE bundle from netbean's download page (<a
          href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/">https://netbeans.org/downloads/</a>.
      Run the installer. When asked to choose which servers to install,
      select tomcat, and deselect GlassFish and any other servers.</p>

    <p>You will be asked for a username and password for a tomcat user. Enter
      something that you will remember.</p>

    <p>Life is much easier if tomcat is the only web server you have installed,
      because any additional server may interfere  with tomcat. For example
      other web servers may grab the ip ports that tomcat wants to use.
      So unless you are really good at configuring the different servers, you
      should not install any other than tomcat.</p>

    <h3>Things to remember</h3>
    <p>The installation creates a few files and directories (folders) that
      you will need later. They are:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>CATALINA_HOME</dt>
      <dd>This is the tomcat installation's main directory.  The environment
        variable CATALINA_HOME will hold the path to this directory.  Actually
        there isn't anything interesting in CATALINA_HOME. It's in the
        subdirectories.</dd>
      <dt>CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml</dt>
      <dd>This is the main configuration file for tomcat.  If you make a
        mistake here, tomcat may stop working. So don't tamper with
        it.  If you must, at least make a backup of the original
        file first</dd>
      <dt>CATALINA_HOME/conf/Context.xml</dt>
      <dd>This file serves the same purpose as the context.xml of the
        application, but the content here is valid for all applications,
        while the content of the project/application's context.xml is only
        valid for the application.</dd>
      <dt id="tomcat-users_xml">CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml</dt>
      <dd>This file contains tomcat's default user database.  The admin user
        that was created during the installation of netbeans is stored here.
        You should be fine if you only add new users, but be careful to get
        the markup right.
      </dd>
    </dl>
