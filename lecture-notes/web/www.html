    <h2>Lecture 1: Web application overview</h2>
    <p>You cannot write web applications if you do not know how the web works.
      The world wide web (appreviated www or the web) was designed by Tim
      Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau in 1989. It was thought of as a system
      where the researcher at CERN could share documents. </p>
    <p>On a more technical level the web is a distributed system of interlinked
      hypertext documents. There is no central server, each one of them exists
      independently of the others.</p>
    <p>Web clients, known as browsers, are used to access the documents on the
      web: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The browsers use the http protocol to communicate with the
        servers.</li>
      <li>The main document format on the web is html, though most browsers can
        display many other document formats.</li>
      <li>A way to create document links is a necessity for a hypertext system.
        Document addresses on the use the url format.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These 3 "standards": html, http and url are the foundations of the web,
      and deserve more attention.</p>
    <p>We will start with the hypertext transfer protocol because it is the
      simplest of the three. Basically, the protocol is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The browser sends a request for a document identified by an url (the
        url identifies the host (server) where the document is located).</li>
      <li>The host responds with a message that contains the requested
        document.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The next section provide a more detailed description of http.</p>
    
    <h3>The HTTP protocol</h3>
    <p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol defines the rules for communication be-
    tween web servers and browsers. HTTP is an application level protocol: It
    is built on top of a transport protocol such as tcp.</p>
    <p>The communication is initiated by the browser when the user clicks on
    a link, or types a URL:</p>
 <ol><li>First the browser opens a TCP connection to the specified port on the
    server. Strictly speaking this is not part of the HTTP protocol, but
    the connection is needed to send any HTTP messages.</li>
    <li>When the connection is established the browser sends an HTTP re-
    quest message. There are several types of request messages. These are
    described below.</li>
    <li>The web server responds with an HTTP response message. The re-
    sponse usually contains the requested resource, but it may also contain
    error messages or other information. The resource is typically an html
    document, or perhaps an image, but it can be any kind of data.</li>
    <li>In the original version of the protocol the TCP connection was closed
    after the response had been sent. Current web browsers and servers
    will usually keep the connection open in anticipation of further requests
    from the browser (for example to retrieve images linked to by a page).</li></ol>
    
    <h4>HTTP Requests</h4>
    <p>The most common request is GET request, which is
    used to retrieve resources, i.e. to follow links. The server’s response to GET
    requests usually contains the requested resource in the message body, but
    the server will send an error message instead if the resource is unavailable.
    If you enter the URL http://www.uia.no/index.html in a browser, the
    following request would be sent:</p>
    
    <code-example>GET /index.html HTTP/1.1</code-example>
    
    <p>Note that GET requests are meant to be used to retrieve information.
    You should never use GET requests to perform irreversible actions, such as
    placing an order, or charging the user’s credit card. The user should get
    exactly the same result whether he clicks just once or several times on a
    link. If you want to perform an action that makes an irreversible change
    to the state of the system, you should use a form to send POST request
    instead.</p>
    <p>The POST request method is used to send data to the server (e.g. the
    data entered in an HTML form - including fileuploads). The data is included 
    in the body of the request. The server may use the data to add new resources,
    or change existing ones.</p>
    <p>The data is sent to the server as request parameters. Each parameter has
    a name and a value. With POST requests, parameters are usually encoded
    in the request body. Even GET requests can have parameters, but they do
    not have a body, so any parameters must be encoded in the URL. We will
    have a closer look at parameters in section TODO xref html</p>
    <p>Web servers are only required to implement the GET and POST methods.
      The other request methods are optional, and are rarely used, so we
    will not go into them here.</p> 
    

    <h4>HTTP Responses</h4>
    <p>The first line of the HTTP Response message contains a three-digit status
      code:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>1xx codes are informational.</li>
    <li>2xx status codes indicate successful processing of the request.</li>
    <li>3xx status codes are used to redirect the browser to another URL.</li>
    <li>4xx status codes indicate that something is wrong with the request. The
    most common is probably
    404 which is sent when the requested resource does not exist.</li>
    <li>5xx status codes indicate a server error while processing the request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the status code the response message may contain additional data.
  The most common status code is 200, which is used when a
    request has been successfully processed, and the resources is being sent in
    the response body.</p>
    <p>The response message is handled by the browser, so we do not need to
    go into more detail. Note however that 4xx and 5xx response will cause the
    browser to display an error message with no link back to the application.
    This is not very user friendly. Therefore you should always try to return a
    normal page, even when something goes wrong in the handling of a request.
    A page with a helpful message and links that allow the user to proceed is a
    lot better than returning an error status.</p>
    
    <h4>The HyperText Markup Language</h4>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) defines the main document
    format of the web. If you want to write web applications you need to know
    HTML. This document is not meant to be a full HTML tutorial. We will only show
    how HTML can be used to provide input to web applications. For more
    information about html you should look for the HTML specification and
    tutorials on W3C’s website [W3C, ].</p>
